Proper statistical treatment is imperative for astrophysical data analysis. While we are typically good at mathematics and modeling, we lack some of the skills developed in the statistical literature. I have listed a collection of papers and websites that provide a starting point for different types of projects as well as safety checks before publishing. 

## General Statistics Papers

* [Dos and don'ts of reduced chi-squared](https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.3754)
* [Understanding better (some) astronomical data using Bayesian methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/1112.3652)
* [Error estimation in astronomy: A guide](https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.2755)

## x/gamma -ray Statistics Papers

* [Statistics: Handle with Care, Detecting Multiple Model Components with the Likelihood Ratio Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0201547)
* [Analysis of Energy Spectra with Low Photon Counts via Bayesian Posterior Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0008170)
* [A method for comparing non-nested models with application to astrophysical searches for new physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01010)

## Statistics Blogs

* Johannes Buchner has developed [BXA](http://johannesbuchner.github.io/BXA/index.html) and [Pymultinest](https://github.com/JohannesBuchner/PyMultiNest). Additionally, he has assembled a useful list of statistics rules. [Check it out](http://astrost.at/istics/minimal-statistics-checklist.html)
* This blog always has some useful astrostats snark [Another Astrostatistics Blog](https://astrostatistics.wordpress.com)
