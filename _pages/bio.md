## Where I am now
I've stumbled into Germany at [MPE](https://www.mpe.mpg.de/main) working with one of my true science idols [Jochen Greiner](http://www.mpe.mpg.de/~jcg/) on an array of topics from GRB prompt emission to dust. We have a small group of students who work a bit too hard and are always surprising me with how clever they are. 

If you have questions about GRBs and/or Fermi-GBM, please contact me or one of the students.


## Where I have been

### KTH

I spent my first postdoctoral fellow ship at KTH in Stockholm, Sweden. My focus was on all things prompt GRB related. It was here that I spent one summer diving into the depths of proper probabilistic modeling and Bayesian inference. 

### UAHuntsville

My strange adopted home town and where I learned to do astrophysics from undergrad to grad school.  




## Music

I play bass. Nothing special. 



There was a time when I was in the same [article](https://www.al.com/entertainment/2012/01/12_huntsville_area_musicians_t.html) as a band that won a Grammy. It was not my band. The last band I did anything serious with was [Oto Benga](https://otobenga.bandcamp.com). A great bunch of dudes trying to say something in a nowhere town.
