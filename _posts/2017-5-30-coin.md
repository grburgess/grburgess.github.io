title: COIN Residence Program 4
---

I will participate in this year's [COIN residence program](https://iaacoin.wixsite.com/crp2017) to work with other astronomers/astrostatisticians to develop new tools and methods (hopefully for gamma-ray spectroscopy). The Cosmostatistics Initiative (COIN), an international  group built under the auspices of the International Astrostatistics Association (IAA), aims to create an interdisciplinary environment where collaborations between astronomers, statisticians and machine learning experts can flourish.  

### Some useful papers the program has used in the past:

* [The overlooked potential of Generalized Linear Models in astronomy, I: Binomial regression](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213133715000360)
* [The overlooked potential of Generalized Linear Models in astronomy-II: Gamma regression and photometric redshifts](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213133715000037)
* [The overlooked potential of generalized linear models in astronomy - III. Bayesian negative binomial regression and globular cluster populations](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015MNRAS.453.1928D)
* [CosmoABC: COSMOABC: Likelihood-free inference via Population Monte Carlo Approximate Bayesian Computation](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:1504.06129)
