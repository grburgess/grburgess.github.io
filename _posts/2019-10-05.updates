title: Updates to mant things

I've decided to get back into this website thing. Last week, Johannes Buchner and I held an x-ray analysis workshop at MPE. The overall impressing was that it was very useful. We will do more of this and the videos/slides will be posted soon. I'm getting more comfortable with stats in general and understanding that the need for education on this topic is dire.

In other news, I'm working on way too many projects. I've dived into the idea of population studies over the past year or so and found that this is also a topic that is poorly understood.
