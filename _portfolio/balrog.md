I developed the BALROG algorithm a few years ago to try and deal with systematics. The [first paper](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/476/2/1427/4670828/?redirectedFrom=fulltext) looked at the general idea. Next, our graduate student, Francesco Berlato examined the systematics of the technique in a [follow-up paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ab0413).
