The study of astrophysical populations is of great interests as it gives us insight in to the distribution, type, number, and properties of objects in the Universe. One of the main things studied in both GRBs and AGN are the luminosity function and redshift distribtuions of these objects.

As I've started working on this topic, I designed a generic population synthesis code in pure python that allows one to simulate populations with the intent of testing inference code on them later. You can find the documentation of the code here: [popsynth.](https://popsynth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
