<p style="font-size: 16px">
Fiddling around with relativistic emission processes to describe gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) can be fun. However, as models (everywhere in astrophyical modeling) become more complex and data more detailed, we have to move to better tools to compare them. So, I've stumbled into the world of astrostatistics. 
<br><br>
Astrostatistics is not just about MCMC sampling, proper likelihoods, or "Big Data." It's about proper model specification, proper implementation of statistical concepts and inference. Everything else follows. In my research and outreach, I try to meld what has been learned in the field of statistical inference with our ability to answer astrophysical questions. Thus, becoming more comfortable with being... uncertain.
